# Password Generator

A simple random password generator built with React and styled with Bootstrap and a bit of Sass. 

## Features
- Select different password difficulties which determine their length: Easy (8), Medium (12) & Hard (16)! (Password length displayed next to the difficulty)
- Password lengths not to your liking? Select custom length to determine your own password length! (Custom length must be above or at 6 characters)
- Select whether or not to include special characters in your password! (Special characters include: ~!@#$%^&*()-_+={[]}|';:/?,.<>)
- Once all of your preferences are selected, simply click the "Generate!" button to generate your password!
- Not a fan of the password generated for you? Passwords are generated randomly and displayed dynamically, so you can click the "Generate!" button as many times until you get a password you are satisfied with!
